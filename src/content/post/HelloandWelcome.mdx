Hello folks, I am Furkan and this is my blog for my technical life journey - I have another general thoughts blog too I will share this later.

### Firstly, who I am?

$$
\frac{56}{45}
$$

As I mentioned in the first paragraph, I am Furkan, and my full name is Furkan Eşref Yazıcı, with the abbreviation "FEY". As you can see, I hail from an ancient lineage - especially "[Archfey](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Archfey)", in a chaotic neutral alignment. Jokes aside, I am a physics student and an undergraduate researcher. Although I don't have any published papers at the moment, I am actively striving to get one. Eventually, I will have a published paper. I have a penchant for being an interdisciplinary individual, so I am inclined to research various topics and fields. Due to this inclination, I aspire to pursue my interests in the computational field, focusing on improving my skills in quantum computation, deep learning, and data science. I have even conducted a workshop on quantum computing with my friends and previously held the position of outreach co-lead in [a prominent quantum community](https://qturkey.org/). Furthermore, as an advocate for interdisciplinary studies, I have an appreciation for complexity science and have engaged in some research within a group in that domain. Nevertheless, I remain a physicist at heart, as I find great satisfaction in being one of them. I can also apply my knowledge of physics to complexity science and other fields, including social sciences. One of my friends is pursuing a sociology PhD with a background in undergraduate physics; he runs a YouTube channel called "[Danbaft](https://www.youtube.com/@DanBaftEnglish)." Physics holds immense significance in our lives, as it provides us with the rules that govern the universe. Currently, I am immersed in researching a specific topic related to quantum computing and data science, with the guidance of my supervisor. Anyway, let's move on to the other, perhaps the most significant part. If you're interested in hearing more about my experiences and stories, I'd be happy to share them at a later time

### We meet, so what is the "fork" about this blog?

As mentioned earlier, I will continue my journey in various fields. In addition to these pursuits, I am continually working on enhancing my skills and understanding in diverse domains, utilizing tools such as quantum computing, data science, machine learning, and more. I will make an effort to share my discoveries and insights with you to the best of my ability. At times, these insights may revolve around topics like blockchain analysis, neuroscience, physics, computer science, or simply quantum computing. Additionally, I may delve into the scientific analysis of games using extensive datasets. Throughout these endeavours, I will consistently employ computational resources and provide references to my sources.

However, before delving into these areas, I plan to begin by exploring the fundamentals of data science, machine learning, and related subjects in-depth. These explorations will take the form of brief lessons, notes, tutorials, or problem-solving approaches, and I will readily share articles and code with all of you. Also, don't worry! I won't use formal language, I will try to use a semi-formal format and I will do my best to use illustrations for explaining details. If time permits, I may even produce short YouTube videos.

This concludes my introductory remarks. Please remember that I am also a student and a perpetual learner. I do not claim that my insights are absolute truths; I am simply striving to do my best. Therefore, if you come across any errors or inaccuracies in my posts, please do not hesitate to discuss them with me. I am open-minded and value constructive discussions conducted with courtesy and respect. Also, I will do most of the illustrations of my blogs - I did a lot of amateur designs before, so don't judge me. :)

You can connect with me on platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and others.

See you later folks!
